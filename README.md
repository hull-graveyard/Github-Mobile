## Installing

First, clone this repository :

    git clone git@github.com:hull/Github-Mobile.git

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (Only used for building the app, not needed for deployment)

[grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) as a global module.
It's amazing so you should do it anyways.

    [sudo] npm install grunt-cli -g
    [sudo] npm install bower -g

then install grunt and it's modules in the project's folder.

    cd Github-Mobile
    npm install
    bower install

## Running the app

### To run the app locally, run:

    grunt server

## What should I know?
* I've only worked on it a single day, obviously it's not released yet, just want to clarify right away
* Uses GitHub's <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/" target="_blank">V3 API</a>
* Stores Access Token from OAuth with Local Storage, giving this webapp ***persistance***
* Read + Write (at least what *can* be written while mobile, stars, followers, issues, etc) 

## What are you going to do?

* The entire GitHub Dashboard
* Users + relations, and ability to follow/unfollow
* Repos, ability to star, fork, submit issues
* Issues, Create, Discuss, Close
* Modify Account
* Notifications (no intent for native alerts at the moment)
* Search Search Search

When all is said and done, instead of uploading this to Apples App store, I will release it on... Bitbucket! 

Just kidding, It will be open sourced on GitHub under the MIT license. The current GitHub clients in the App Store all look like crap and *are not free*. What the fuck?

##### Notes for 1-13-2013
I am concerned about a few major flaws in the application. Push.js from Ratchet is really annoying, but necessary, it is just a pain in the ass to extend, the flow of the app is weak. Will do an overhaul of that once everything is set in place.
